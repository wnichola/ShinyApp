## US Weather Data: Impact on Population Health and Economy
This application explores the weather data provided from Coursera as part of the Reproducible Research course [https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/repdata%2Fdata%2FStormData.csv.bz2'

The source data contains records from 1950 to 2011, however, as a lot of the data are unclean from the earlier time period, only data from 2001 has been taken into consideration for this Weather Data Impact Exploration Application.

In addition, there has been substantive data cleaning performed to nomalise the data.  Only the clean data is used for this Data Exploration Application. For the raw data, please click on the link above.

## Usage
To use the Shiny Application, adjust the Date Range slider for the Start and End years that the data should include.  This will cause the system to recompute the summary information on the impact on both Economy and Health, and the tables and charts will refresh itself to reflect the latest computation.  

By default, the top 5 events are predefined.  You can use the textbox to adjust the number of top events that you want to highlight, upto a maximum of 10.
